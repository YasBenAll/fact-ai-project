# On the reproducibility of ”Fairness Guarantees under Demographic Shift”

This repository contains the code used for the paper [On the reproducibility of ”Fairness Guarantees under Demographic Shift”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). It is largely similar to the original codebase of the ICLR 2022 paper [Fairness Guarantees under Demographic Shift](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wbPObLm6ueA), but contains the following contributions:

- An env.yaml file containing the correct requirements for reproducing the experiments
- Adjustments made to the code to run it without errors on all machines (Linux, Windows, and Mac)
- Code to aggregate and save results to json, calculation of statistics and generation of latex tables
- Additional experiments on different bound sizes and optimization methods

## Requirements

After cloning this repository, simply run:

```setup
conda env create -f Python/env.yaml
conda activate fact
```

The datasets are already contained in this repository.

## Reproduction

### Reproducing results of original paper

The experiments from the original paper, which were also reproduced in our implementation, can be executed by running the provided file from the `Python` directory, as follows:

```train
# on Linux/Mac: 
./experiments/scripts/iclr_ds_experiments.sh

# on Windows:
experiments/scripts/iclr_ds_experiments.bat
```

Hyperparameters and models are specified in this file. After running these experiments, their results can be extracted to json by running:

```extract
python experiments/scripts/results_to_json.py
```

The figures can be created by running 

```figures
python -m experiments.scripts.iclr_figures_adult
python -m experiments.scripts.iclr_figures_adult --unknown_ds
python -m experiments.scripts.iclr_figures_brazil
python -m experiments.scripts.iclr_figures_brazil --unknown_ds
```

The new figures will be saved to `Python/figures/*` by default. The tables, together with the statistical analysis, can be generated by running 

```tables
python experiments/scripts/stats_to_latex.py
```

### Reproducing results beyond original paper

#### Bound size of unknown demographic shift

This experiment can be reproduced by running:

```bounds
# on Linux/Mac
./experiments/scripts/bounds.sh

# on Windows
experiments/scripts/bounds.bat
```

Again, the results can be extracted to json format by running 

```extract
python experiments/scripts/results_to_json.py
```

and then, the plot shown in our paper can be created by running 

```plots
python experiments/scripts/plot_bounds.py
```

This will save the plot to `figures/Bounds.png`.


## Results

The model designed by the authors of the reproduced paper achieves the following performance on the given datasets:

| Dataset name       | Accuracy without demographic shift  | Accuracy with demographic shift |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)            |                                   80.2% |                                78.8% |
| [Brazil](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/O35FW8)           |                                   61.3% |                                62.4% |
